At [playground.digital.auto](https://playground.digital.auto), we've listened to your feedback and identified some limitations in the architecture of v1. To address these, we're excited to announce a new version with significant improvements!
- Python applications utilize the standard Velocitas library. 
- Python applications can leverage external libraries, enabling the development of a wide range of applications.
- Widgets are fully plug-and-play, with no dependency on any specific model.
- UX improvements enhance user-friendliness.
- Rust Language Support: Write, compile, and execute Rust code with a single click. Supports 100 popular Rust libraries by default.
- New Feature: Staging replaces the previous Deploy dialog, simplifying the management of deployments from the development environment to target hardware.
- SDV Runtime: A Docker image serves as the execution environment for SDV applications, accommodating both Python and Rust applications. Users can either utilize numerous shared runtimes provided by us or deploy their own runtime on their local machine or in the cloud.
- Asset Management: Users can add and manage their own SDV runtimes or hardware kits, ensuring exclusive usage and controlled sharing. Furthermore, users can share their assets with collaborators.

Several key considerations should be addressed when migrating from version 1 to version 2: [view](/releases/version2)
