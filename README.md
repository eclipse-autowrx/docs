# Playground documentation

The digital.auto playground documentation is realized with GitHub pages. It is generated by [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) with [Learn Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-learn/) theme, from the markdown files in the `\docs` folder.
The static webpage is generated automatically after every PR merged to master branch, according to the configured GitHub workflow `\.github\workflows\hugo.yaml`

The official documentation page is hosted at https://docs.digital.auto

## Dependencies

The static page is generated with:

-   [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/)
-   [Learn Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-learn/)

Please follow the [documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) for installation and further questions around the framework.
Currently, the HUGO version used for generating VSS documentation is `0.115.4`,

## Run the documentation server locally
